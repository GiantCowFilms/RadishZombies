#History

Radish made a zombie game, and cow played the game. Cow liked it, and requested the express implementation of a jeep (so that he could blow up zombies more vigorously).
Radish called on X-27 to implement the jeep, which promptly failed to integrate. Cow and Radish tried, and soon many others were working on it. 
It was then added to GitHub, in order to make the chaos give some semblance of order.

#Chat

This is where we disorganize the project:
