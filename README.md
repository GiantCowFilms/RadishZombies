Radish's Zombie Game

Iâ€™ve actually never done this before, but the cow and others have. (Btw this is radish talking) we're working on a game in Blender 3D's game engine, partially just to prove that Yes, blender does have one.
This game is focused around a cube that wields a Gatling gun to cut down opposing forces the "Zombies" the ""'s are there, cause they aren't really zombies, just little green cubes that have obscene pleasure in chewing on faces.
Thanks to X-27 for the jeep... we will try to get it in all the way... Right now we are undergoing major re-org because previously i had done it, and my organizational skills (lack thereof) are absolutely legendary.
