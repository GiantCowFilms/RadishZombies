    Player:
W A S D Moves the player. Use the mouse to aim. Left Click Fires. Right Click jumps. Middle mouse (click) to put away or bring out your minigun.
Pressing R uses one of your ammo refils, and sets your ammo to 55. Only use this when your ammo is low or empty, because it will use an entire ammo refil regardless of how much ammo is actually added to your clip.
The minigun will not automaticly re-load (something I would have changed)
Press G to throw a grenade. They will detonate shortly after hitting the ground, killing all zombies, and destroying all pickups within the blast radious. You only have one grenade per ammo box. You do not start with a grenade, so do not try to throw oneoff the start.
Pick up the small ammo boxes to add one more ammo refill to your player, and add one grenade. You can only hold one grenade at a time, so alwayse throw your greande before picking up another ammo box.
Pick up a syringe to restore all of your health. Again, the syringe will be used regardless of how much health is actually restored.
Walk up to the driver side of the jeep,  press E to enter it, and E to dismount again.
Walking into water slows down the player. 
Wlking with your gun out also slows the player, store it to walk faster.

The first number from the left on the HUD is how many bullets you have in your minigun clip.
The second is how many re-fills you have left.
The third will be 1 if you have a grenade to throw, and 0 if you do not.
The fourth number is how many newly spawned zombies you have killed. (The ones occupying the level at the start do not count)


    When in the jeep:
Arrow Keys drive. Space is handbreak. Comma Fires a missle. You must be going Below 10 speed to fire a missile. Drive into the palets containing missiles to reload the missile launcher.
W and S aim the missile luncher up and down. One pallet of missiles will fill the launcher and be used, regarddless of how many missiles are actually added to the launcher, if any. (Only pick up if you reallly need them)
Missiles have a much larger blast radious than the grenades. the will also destroy evreything within the radious of the blast, zombies and pickups alike. 
Hint: The missiles are very powerful and should only be used as a last defense, escaping from a corner, or for clearing heavily grouped mobs of zombies.

The Jeep's fuel system works as follows: 

The gas tank has a capacety of 100 total fuel points.
A gas can restores 50 fuel points.
The jeep has a spare gas can on the back which can be used at any time to re-fill the main fuel tank by 50 fuel points. (press F)
When your fuel tank drops below 25 fuel points, the spare gas can will  automaticly be used.
Once the spare gas can has been used, it can be restored by obtaining more fuel.

When the player has a can of gas, and brings it back to the jeep, the jeep will respond as follows:

If the jeep's fuel tank is below 25 fuel points, and there is no spare can to be used,  50 fuel points will be added to the gas tank.
If the jeep's fuel tank is above 25 fuel points, and there is no spare can, a new spare can will be added to the back.
If the jeep's fuel tank is below 50 fuel points, and there already is a spare can, 50 fuel points will be added to the gas tank.
If the jeep's fuel tank is above 50 fuel points, and there already is a spare can, the fuel tank will be filled, and the rest will be watsed.



The jeep's armor, for a very strage reason (I would have made it differnetly) can only be damaged when the player is in the jeep, and the jeep is out of fuel.
When the jeep's armor reaches 0, the jeep will explode, you will be ejected, and you will not be able to re-enter.

Do not drive into deep water, for this jeep has no snorkle, and the jeep will drown (you will be ejected and will not be able to re enter)

The goal of the game is to survive as long as posible.
