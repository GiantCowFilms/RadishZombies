Go for the little brown boxes! they give you
ammo refills. The syrynges give you your health back, use them sparingly
Dont stand still. An injured zombie will die eventually.
middle click to get your gun out, hit "R" to reload
If your gun won't reload, you need another refill box.
The first text field is how much ammo you have in your current clip
the second is how many clips you have left
and the third is how many cloned zombies you've killed

BTW you are faster with your gun stowed. good luck!!!
