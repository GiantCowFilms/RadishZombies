Go for the little brown boxes! they give you
ammo refills. The syrynges give you your health back, use them sparingly


Dont stand still. An injured zombie will die eventually.
middle click to get your gun out, hit "R" to reload

If your gun won't reload, you need another refill box.

the first text field is how much ammo you have in your current clip

the second is how many clips you have left

and the third is how many cloned zombies you've killed

the 15 or some-odd zombies that are in the game when it starts don't count toward your score


BTW you are faster with your gun stowed. good luck!!!

7.3401 wheel distance, F to B
