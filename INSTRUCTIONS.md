# Game instructions

##Player:
W A S D Moves the player. Use the mouse to aim. Left Click Fires. Right Click jumps. Middle mouse (click) to put away or bring out your mini gun.
Pressing R uses one of your ammo refills, and sets your ammo to 55. Only use this when your ammo is low or empty, because it will use an entire ammo refill regardless of how much ammo is actually added to your clip.
The mini gun will not automatically re-load!
Press G to throw a grenade. They will detonate shortly after hitting the ground, destroying all pick-ups & zombies within the blast radios. You only have one grenade per ammo box. You do not start with a grenade.
Pick up the small ammo boxes to add one more ammo refill to your player, and add one grenade. You can only hold one grenade at a time, any more collected grenades will be lost.
Pick up a syringe to restore all of your health. Again, the syringe will be used regardless of how much health is actually restored.
Walk up to the driver side of the Jeep, press E to enter it, and E to dismount again.
Walking into water slows down the player. 
Walking with your gun out also slows the player, holster it to walk faster.

The first number from the left on the HUD is how many bullets you have in your mini gun clip.
The second is how many re-fills you have left.
The third will be 1 if you have a grenade to throw, and 0 if you do not.
The fourth number is how many newly spawned zombies you have killed. (The ones occupying the level at the start do not count)


You may not drive the Jeep unless you are in it.

##When in the Jeep:
Arrow Keys drive. Space is handbrake. Comma Fires a missile. You must be going Below 10 speed to fire a missile. Drive into the palest containing missiles to reload the missile launcher.
W and S aim the missile luncher up and down. One pallet of missiles will fill the launcher and be used, regardless of how many missiles are actually added to the launcher, if any. (Only pick up if you really need them)
Missiles have a much larger blast radios than the grenades. the will also destroy everything within the radios of the blast, zombies and pick-ups alike. 
Hint: The missiles are very powerful and should only be used as a last defence, escaping from a corner, or for clearing heavily grouped mobs of zombies.

####The Jeep's fuel system works as follows: 

The gas tank has a capacity of 100 total fuel points.
A gas can restores 50 fuel points.
The Jeep has a spare gas can on the back which can be used at any time to re-fill the main fuel tank by 50 fuel points. (press F)
When your fuel tank drops below 25 fuel points, the spare gas can will  automatic be used.
Once the spare gas can has been used, it can be restored by obtaining more fuel.

####When the player has a can of gas and brings it back to the Jeep the Jeep will respond as follows:

- If the Jeep's fuel tank is below 25 fuel points and there is no spare can to be used 50 fuel points will be added to the gas tank.
- If the Jeep's fuel tank is above 25 fuel points and there is no spare can a new spare can will be added to the back.
- If the Jeep's fuel tank is below 50 fuel points and there already is a spare can 50 fuel points will be added to the gas tank.
- If the Jeep's fuel tank is above 50 fuel points and there already is a spare can the fuel tank will be filled and the rest will be wasted.

When the Jeep's fuel reaches 0, it will not drive. You can only sit there or dismount!

You may get more fuel to the Jeep to be able to drive it again.

The Jeep's armor, can only be damaged when the player is in the Jeep and Jeep is out of fuel.
When the Jeep's armor reaches 0, the Jeep will explode, you will be ejected, and you will not be able to re-enter.

Do not drive into deep water, for this Jeep has no snorkel and the Jeep will drown (you will be ejected and will not be able to re-enter)

##The goal of the game is to survive as long as possible.
